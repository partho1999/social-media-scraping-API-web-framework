In particular, I thought they handled Peter's identity being revieled really well. I loved how the camera nervously followed everybody in the house. I thought there was some interesting shots. I do agree there was some cuts and editing I didn't enjoy. But I think this film had the most character. And it's definitely the most daring. At first I was a little hesitant or upset with the ending. But that decision is really daring to me, and impactful, and it really shows Peter's maturity and how much he's grown. Especially compared to all the immaturity in the previous films, although the whole plot of this movie was because his immaturity. But by the end of the film he's believably the Spider-Man we all know and love. Not Iron-Mam Jr....\", \"This movie was I can't even describe. It was more than just fan service, it felt like everyone behind this film really came together and produced a great send-off for the Holland trilogy.\", 'As much as there was pure joy in my heart whenever Raimi characters were on screen, I was really happy for Andrew and Jamie.

Peter fixed his mistakes of putting those he loved in danger before it was too late (like Aunt May) but he paid the prize of being left alone in the world, stranger to everyone. He knew he wont bring their memories back and it would never be the same because bonds are built throught common experiences and he would never talk MJ into loving him again so he  picked to never meet her and Ned and let them live a safe and happy lifes. So bittersweet, I cant. Great story, wow. I didnt really love far from home and found Tom\\'s Spiderman \"Iron Man Jr.\" and it bothered me, but this ending made Peter come back to his roots in a believable way which is great. My feelings are so mixed. I dont know if I am happy or sad. Very good finish to the \"Home\" series. Future seems exciting.', 'This movie exceeded expectations in almost every way.

And we have the same little tree in our sets that’s so cool!!', 'I got the feeling that they kept cutting away from the “villains” cause of the de-aging effects.

I could tell the actors weren’t actually acting in the same room as holland. Marvel has been doing this for a while. It’s not unusual they reshoot same scenes separately or again weeks apart.

Spider-Man was his favorite creation and this is by far not only the best Spider-Man movie but one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. Definitely on level with Infinity war and end game.

I still can't get over the fact that no way home gave the spidey fans so much more than what we wanted ️️\", \"Definitely the best of the 3, but I think I was expecting more. Feels like it was a little overhyped. The biggest issue I have is the level of stupid that is  displayed to set No Way Home’s plot into motion is just ridiculous. He’s a superhero who just lived through a truly devastating, world-altering supernatural event and yet he thinks it’s a good idea to conjure a spell simply because he can’t handle the fallout of having his identity revealed? And then when a bunch of bad guys FROM DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS show up and there’s a quick and easy fix to send them back, he decides it’d be better TO TRY TO “HEAL THEM” ? Once that happened, it just wasn't what I was expecting and it kind of left me feeling underwhelmed.\", 'I think we\\'re all getting very exhausted from studios grabbing at the \"nostalgia\" and fan-service gimmick, but the way this film was written completely makes it stand out from that. There was one specific scene, even a couple of lines in the scene, that made the entire movie for me. It was both completely true for Spider-Man as a character, and something I coincidentally needed to hear at this point in my life. Tears went pouring after that point.', 'First time I was in a movie theatre where people were clapping and cheering during certain scenes since I saw The Force Awakens in 2015.

I\\'m talking about the overall vibe/performance of the character, not just his face.)', \"The problem of William Dafoe not getting enough face time happened with doc oct as well and honestly I think it's because of the de-aging.

I can still hear the hype in the theater. I was excited to see the new Spidey. Tom is actually like the comics. Young,naive,unassuming and energetic.

Moments like him standing in the rain after May passed away.....epic.\", 'As someone in the UK, this movie is the first and only time the audience has been audible in the cinema.

Got to see the film on Friday. AMAZING. I felt Tom Hollands Spider-Man and his friends/family were in danger from start to finish. That’s never been the case for the past couple of movies. Dafoe was phenomenal as Green Goblin as always. He was the antagonist Peter needed to BECOME Spider-Man. I will be rewatching it on Monday. Your review was SPOT ON! Cant wait for your spoiler review.', \"I've seen a lot of movies online and in theaters this year (masked up for safety). But this was the first one where the audience was actually applauding once the film ended. I was one of them.\\n\\nThis was such a fantastic movie!

I loved seeing Toby and Andrew in this one as well', \"Here in Belgium, almost no one says a word during movies. The fact that people applauded and screamed, and I mean *screamed*, here says a lot. Still shaking about the fact that this movie actually exists, it's like a fever dream.\", 'It was an amazing movie. I avoided my phone for 4 days before watching the film. And it was my genuine reaction to the movie. And I guess everyone else in the movie theater was the same as me. It was incredible being there in the movie theater. I love love the movie. The acting was incredible and green goblin again. Wow!!! He said okay I’m playing green goblin again and did that. 10/10 for me', 'After finally watching it this past Christmas Eve, I can agree that there are parts in which some of the characters don\\'t feel like they occupy the same space when they are meant to. It makes me wonder that since I\\'m sure this movie was filmed during the height of the pandemic, if they really HAD to film  most of the scenes separately? I\\'d be very curious to watch the Blu-ray behind-the-scenes if they ever touch on how the pandemic affected the filming schedule. Like, were there some times when Jamie Fox literally just put up a green screen in his own home and a camera crew, costume crew and makeup crew showed up with some lights and audio equipment and just filmed some of his talking lines? LOL And I\\'m sure Thomas Haden Church as Sandman just voiced in a lot of his lines, since he wasn\\'t hardly ever in the \"flesh\" in that movie, he was in \"sand\" mode the whole time, so he was of course 100% CGI, same with The Lizard. Plus I\\'m sure they did some de-aging on a lot of the characters too, thats probably why they didn\\'t keep the camera cuts on characters for too long. \\n\\nOverall though I really loved the movie. It was the first time in the Tom Holland movies that it really felt like there were some serious stakes for Spider-Man. The first two core films felt like they were fun, but not really much at stake, you know? This felt serious, and I liked that better.', 'The feels...\\nThe chills...\\nTHE EMOTIONS !!\\nI cried like a baby...

I didn’t like the overall use of CGI, even some of the CGI were kinda bad. The villains were freaking amazing! This is by far the best Tom Holland Spider-Man film, still not the best Spider-Man film.', \"Love your videos Chris! I had so much fun with this movie and I'm going to be posting my own review soon. One thing I was very excited to see was SPOILER INCOMING\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWas Charlie Cox as Daredevil.

Loved it.  *Spoiler Free* I noticed the same thing Chris Stuckman noticed about this film.  There were some camera angle and choices made that indicate that not every one of the villains were in the same room together.  As someone who used to be an actor and filmmaker, yes there is a chance they were trying to keep certain aspects of the film top secret from being leaked out, but there was also a chance certain actors had scheduling conflicts.  Like maybe as an example, Jamie Foxx could only commit for a few days of filming, while Alfred Molina could commit to 1 day of filming.  Just an example, but maybe that's one other reason why we don't see everyone on camera all at the same time.  Then again, Jon Watts may have been under time constraints and just needed to finish the movie with close-ups rather than having large master shots with everyone.  But anyway, great film, it's a lot to take in, but it's very entertaining, and definitely recommend.\", \"The respect that YouTube reviewers are showing for this movie is commendable, protecting the elements of the story that might be spoilers.

Thanks for this review man. ️.', 'William Dafoe stole the show as Green Goblin and is definitely Spider-Man’s best villain', 'I thought it was phenomenal, I’d give it an A or an A+, it was that good.\\n\\nMaybe I’m just old-fashioned, but I always preferred the simpler superhero formula (time travel and dimensions can get a little crazy sometimes), which is why I think Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man movie. But luckily for No Way Home, it didn’t feel too messy.\\n\\nBut I’m going to move on and give my praise to No Way Home. It’s basically a HUGE improvement over its two predecessors. It’s more mature (it’s got good humor, but there’s not too* much humor), the characters and character relationships are deeper, there’s better “messages or lessons”, it’s more impactful to the audience (there were actually people in my theater crying), and I think it benefited from having a longer run-time. I also gotta give major props to Tom Holland for stepping up his game; I know he’s a talented actor, but he seemed kinda soft in his past appearances as Peter Parker. But this time, he was more serious, showed more emotions, and truly showed off his talent! And finally, Willem Dafoe is just as good in this one as he was in his original appearance, he was so freaking dead accurate (in terms of personality) to the comic book version of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin', 'I loved it. I just seen it with my dad and the audience was going crazy when all the spidermans came together. It was just a great time and after the movie my dad took me to Wing Stop so I had a more perfect night', \"The atmosphere in the theater was amazing.

Saw it a few hours ago, highly highly satisfied!', 'Tom and Zendaya’s on screen chemistry is insane and I don’t mean romantically, just in general.', 'When someone said,\"is that better for them or more convenient for us\" I LOVED that! I love that it was a jab against those who are against immigration or taking in refugees... I want to see more stuff like that in movies... Even the newer Star Wars hasn\\'t been as progressive as I would like it to be...', 'I have never in my entire life watched a movie as good, absolutely speechless', 'Absolutely had a blast. Tom really felt the turmoil of a double life and truly embraced his duties. How they plan Spider-Man 4 with Tom I highly anticipate to know.', 'Not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination. More fan service than story, but has its moments. Would like to see more of the villains. All in all, I did enjoy the movie and will definitely watch it again.', 'Dafoe brought an evil that’s been missing from the MCU Spidey, as much as I loved Keaton in homecoming, he wasn’t evil.  Here a goblin from another franchise altogether, and instantly Dafoe becomes Joker level notorious to Holland’s Spidey.  I never thought we’d get a sinister six like storyline without some heavy establishment films, but kudos to Marvel for rehashing Sonys early victories and failures to deliver us one in a single movie.', 'The theater I had was amazing! When Toby and Andrew came on screen they were screaming and cheering. That’s an experience I will remember for the rest of my life', 'This movie gave fans everything they could’ve asked for, while still telling a dramatic and strong story. It knows that it is nostalgia based fun and they dive deep into that. Yet, it did not lose its own identity. Movie gave a rollercoaster of emotions. Nostalgia, sadness, happiness, and intense action moments. The shockers alone are enough to pay for. Overall this movie is extremely well balanced in every facet. They kept the villains following one plot, instead of breaking them into long drawn out subplots. It learned from the past two Spider-Man failures. \\nAll of my gripes for this movie are mostly picky but the movie gets a pass as it’s selling a lot to the audience. Some dialogue, and some jokes felt corny. It felt as if some characters have to just say something from their universe to connect it but also give personality to the character. If someone who hasn’t seen the other movies needs to get the personalities some some lines are pandered to that. Nit picky, but still fine.', '4:12 is exactly how i felt watching the final battle and various parts throughout the third act. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and was just like “WTF is going on”?', 'I watched this earlier today in the theater. Really enjoyed most things about it. I really like Doctor Strange.

If you do these things, I hunt you down.\" Awesome.', \"I was born in 2002 so Green Goblin has been a character I've known practically my whole life and same with Spider-Man so seeing Toby and Willem back on screen was so damn satisfying\", 'I gotta see this movie again and again, just incredible and the acting from everyone was so so good. I had such a great time and it just might be my top 3 favorite marvel movie.', 'I loved this FIlm as it represented 3 vital stages of a man. Tom is the 18 year old undecided.

And tobey is the mature adult sure of himself and father like.', 'i saw it yesterday and anyone from the uk knows that the most you generally get out of cinema audiences are laughs. this film had a full screen of people clapping, cheering, laughing, gasping and crying. it was the most incredible atmosphere. no way home brought that out in the audience. it’s so rare. this is an extremely special film and i loved every second of it. it exceeded my already high expectations which i did not expect', 'I just saw it and really did enjoy it. I will say that this was a big fan service but the story was solid that I didn’t think much of it. Also every cameo from both spideys and villains had their place. It didn’t feel forced, including some meme moments. Overall I wouldn’t mind seeing it again.', 'spider-verse is still the best feature length spider-man movie. but this is pretty up there now. \\n\\nit\\'s great that all of the villains had their own motivations.

This movie is meant to be bought. ', 'Saw the movie yesterday. Best Spider-Man movie in the history of Spider-Man. I really wanna go back and binge every movie now and finish off with this one again', 'Possibly controversial opinion, but I think they did Dafoe way more justice as Green Goblin in this film, than in the OG Spider-Man.\\n\\nHe was terrifyingly great and his presence felt like the more psychotic Goblin straight from the comics.

I would’ve liked it a lot more if it was a pure storytelling move that progressed Spider-Man’s arc in the MCU.  But was it though?  Because it seemed solely motivated by Sony wanting to keep their leech-claws hooked firmly into Spidey’s movie rights and retain some ability to pull Holland out of the MCU while still claiming it’s the same Spider-Man.  (*cough BULLSHIT *cough)\\n\\nI’m happy MCU got to borrow S-Man from Sony for several years to create the amazing world they did, but if Spidey does fully go back to Sony with no MCU ties anymore, the result will probably be a disaster.  It took a lot more than Tom Holland to make this version of Spidey such a blowout success.  It took all the combined might, vision, creativity, intelligence, wit, charm, and deft touch of nuance and subtlety that specifically the MCU has to really make it happen - NONE of which the ham-fisted Sony has.\\n\\nIF they\\'re keeping Spidey still in the MCU, then all may be well in the end.  There would hopefully be a satisfying payoff scene years down the line where MJ and Ned finally remember Peter again, and thus not completely \"erasing\" everything that came before as meaningless - which it effectively IS right now.  But in the meantime, Sony will do whatever it can to use Holland as a jumping-off platform for their own underperforming Spider-verse crap (not counting the animated one).  It\\'s gonna be a studio dogfight all the way down, and Spider-Man will only suffer for it.\\n\\n(And regardless of whether the world knows who Peter Parker is or not, they STILL know Spider-Man’s an Avenger who helped save the universe from Thanos.  Everyone and anyone still involved with the Avengers still knows it as well.  Hulk, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant-Man, Strange, Wong, Fat Thor, Nick Fury, Captain Marvel etc...  So how is Spidey all of a sudden not an Avenger anymore?  Makes no damn sense.)', 'I just saw it and I’m definitely seeing it again.

I mean there is a ton of potential, but it's mostly wasted by a poor execution. Acting was good (some of it was excellent, Dafoe and Molina especially) but it all felt rushed, some of the most important moments were awfully dull in their execution. Nostalgia can be good if it's paired with some good new content, but here everything was just meh to me.

And while I agree with you that Jon Watts' editing choices were sometimes iffy, I would also say thay some of his shot compositions are some of the most beautiful of not just the MCU but of any superhero movie.

The theater was packed as much as Covid regulation allowed it, and it really made for a great watching with a crowd experience.

We basically applauded the entire movie from beginning to end, even up to the two end credits scenes. And the movie was so deserving all the cheers and support too. The action was spot on, and the plot twists were really unexpected. Even the scenes shown in the trailers didn't do any justice to what really went down in the movie itself, and I'm so glad for it too, as it made my mind blow when I saw the real actions and revealers. What I really liked, and I hope it's not a spoiler to say it, is that it was completely Tom Holland's Spider man movie through and through, even with so many characters from the Raimi and Watt's movies coming over. There was also such an a amazing chemistry between all actors and their characters, both the MCU guys and the returning heroes. Speaking of returning heroes, William Defoe absolutely stole the show, and his updated portray of the Green Goblin was such a nice surprise. He was the king of plot twists in the movie, and every time he came on screen you knew that things are going down. Can't forget Alfred Molina as well, and his pretty unexpected take on Doc Oc. He was my favorite part of the movie, and brought a lot of heart into it. But most importantly, I was blown away for how much respect this movie paid for the entire cinematic history of Spiderman on screen, and how lovingly it portrayed both the MCU side of the movie as all the past movies too. The ending was fantastic, and it made for a great soft reboot of the entire Spiderman live action saga.

I went with great expectations like everyone else and enjoyed the fan service moments they served but that's it. It was a good experience watching in the cinema hall but it's not a movie that you would like to revisit often, nor a memorable movie.

On the other hand remember infinity war where captain America returned and it was a goosebump scene and in the same movie Thor return blew up further ! It is for those moments one revisits those movies again. This movie had the potential but blew it up ! Plus had they focused on the characters and not the actors it would have been a much better film. By that I mean since all the earlier actors were returning you had to use their faces and not cgi so the movie seems to be developed that way. Electro is visible all the time. Goblin let go his helmet. Tobey and Andrew were without their mask most of the screen time. The final fight was also a let down. Again remember the civil war airport scene?

The characters at times felt way more stiff and not as natural in their roles as the first two films, mainly Ned and Happy.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!\\n\\n\\nAlso, you could tell Andrew and Toby were struggling to get back into their characters, Toby more so than Andrew. I feel the writers had such a unique opportunity to create some really amazing dialogue but they went for (tacky at times) one liners or conversation that, again, just didn\\'t feel natural (for example, when Toby keeps telling Andrew \"he\\'s special\" or whatever I forget the specific line but they just keep going on and it just goes on for far too long). Another thing is, at least to me, what made the Tom Holland Spiderman films fun and unique to watch were the relationships he had around him, especially with Ned and MJ, also with May and Happy. They helped build the atmosphere that, at least to me, helped me enjoy the films to their full potential. And to take that away is a massive blow.

He starts off as a good guy then just switches because electro told him to? Like why would sandman want to stay? He literally just wanted to see is daughter again. \\n\\nThat’s about all \\n\\nI loved the fan service \\n- Andrew saving mj was great \\n- doc oc and Peter 2’s conversation was great at the end \\n- the three spidermen just being spider bros was awesome\\n-Matt Murdock was great in the short scene  he was in (which they really need to make a live action daredevil and punisher movie now)\\n\\nMy final thing about the movie I enjoyed was how they hammered home the careful what you wish for theme \\n\\nOverall I enjoyed this movie and I’m more excited for what’s next for Peter now more than ever \\n\\nAlso venom is awesome', 'To me it was underwhelming, but I enjoyed it.

I mean take Spiderman 2, the scene after Doc Oc is in the hospital after his chip malfunctions and he fuses to the tentacle arms. That scene was brilliant and totally visionary when compared to anything in this film. I just wish they realized this story called for a bit more pizazz in the cinematography. Even in Far from Home we got some awesome stuff with Mysterio, even if it was all CGI. I don\\'t think the film was bad by any means, I enjoyed it. I just wanted the concept to actually go all the way, I was hoping Into The Spiderverse would be incorporated, or they would actually have some challenging villains\\' to overcome.

Like they didn\\'t believe we could feel it without the score telling us what emotion to feel. Truly felt insulted by some of the musical ques in the \"sad\" scenes.

However, the mid-credits scene shows Venom in that universe for a bit. Is that saying that Venom knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man in his own universe, a guy we’ve never seen?

BUT I have issues. I think they could have cut back on the humor. I know it’s Marvel but this felt gratuitous even for them. I feel like it should have been split into two parts. It was rushed and there was SO much packed in that we really needed more time to savor what was happening. Lastly and this is a big one…I felt like certain characters got way more Justice, spotlight, and love than others and it would have been nice for EVERYONE to get their moment in the sun on equal ground. All in all I enjoyed the film but it’s a far cry from what I was hoping to see.

Considering all the hype I expected this to be the best Spider-Man film yet but it didn't have the sustained joy and excitement of some of the earlier ones. I suppose that's the price of being grander in scope. The slightly darker tone didn't mesh well with the weaker-than-average MCU humour which undercut much of the drama. Liked a couple of the early action scenes but not the end one - for reasons that mostly involve spoilers. Too much fan service and call-backs to older films - felt a bit like the recent Star Wars movies in that respect. These days everything seems to have to interconnect (even Bond) to encourage curious viewers to go on side-quests in order to maximize franchise revenue. That's fine for diehard fans who lap it all up but can feel like a particularly confusing party where you don't know half the guests for anyone who hasn't got up to speed. I understood what they were trying to do with this film being fairly familiar with all the other Spider-Man movies and enjoyed certain aspects of it but I felt like they over-reached and it buckled under its own 'cleverness'. By no means rubbish - it's still a decent, entertaining watch - but for me it's been blown up to almost Avengers: Endgame levels and unlike that movie, didn't quite deliver on its potential.

The choice to erase everyones memory of him at the end was justified since stakes were high and it was a emergency situation.we should expect more seriousness and better judgement from a guy like dr strange.\\n\\n2.The villains have no pay off at all. I can like what they did with otto and norman. But electro, sandman, lizard were there just for the sake of it.\\n\\n3.They also failed to create a necessity for the villains to be stopped at the end since they weren't really planning to do anything with the powers and freedom they got after they escaped from peter. Its like they were waiting to be cured and be sent back to there dimensions. Like not a single one of them tried to find that box themselves since their survival in this world was at stake because of that box. Like there was no sense of danger at all.\\n\\n4.Are they really trying to say that any random guy with a trace of magical capabilities is capable of opening a portal and bring a specific person. Like seriously...?? Lol. Even dr strange himself took days to learn that\\n\\n5.most of the choices peter made throughout were just a excuse to move the plot forward. There was no logic behind them nor the consideration of their consequences.\\n\\n\\nThe lack of logic and realism behind the choices that drive the plot of this movie are not worth the emotional weight this movie tries to shoulder \\n\\n\\nWhat i am trying to say that this movie mostly works because the amount of payoff and nostalgia it provides you. But as a cost you have to turn of your logical thinking and enjoy the dose of nostalgia it gives.\\n\\nBut after that weans off, you'll be left with the realisation that its just a average superhero film and nothing to be raved about.\\n\\nInto the spider-verse is a much better movie  to tackle the multiverse.\\n\\nWhile spiderman 2 remains best spiderman movie.\\n\\nI Dont know what future this version peter parker in mcu holds but atleast i hope it won't be marred by mindless narrative choices like this one.\\n\\nPerformances were top notch though.\", 'my rating is A+', 'Watched it in London last night, most people including myself went absolutely mad.', 'Are you going to review \"Welcome to Raccoon City\", Chris?

If you are someone who isn't a big MCU Spiderman fan because he feels more like Ironboy Jr or even Spiderboy, I can confidently say that you will appreciate Toms Spiderman a whole lot more after this film. I thought Tom had great acting moments in his last two previous Spiderman films but they never really used him as well as he was in The Devil All The Time but he is amazing in this film. I think most of the villains were used for more than just fan service. Otto character was handled great, I found Goblin to be better in this film than he was in Spiderman 2002 and Electro was improved but sadly two others were rather casted to the side.

It seems like this movie is a collage of the SpiderVerse, the SpiderMan ps4 game and your childhood Nostalgia. \\n\\nI dunno. With what happens at the end (iykyk) it just seems really ugly to me. They can literally soft reboot this thing for another trilogy and wipe the slate clean. Cause honest to god I don't feel emotionally connect to any of the characters in Holland's version. I feel like his character has gone through the responsibility arc for 3 goddamn movies. With multiple traumatising events happening to him since Homecoming, infinity war etc. You'd think thatd trauma would heavily impact him. Nope. Still makes the same dumbshit decisions and all. Character continuity isn't a factor for this version of the character. It's event continuity. Like new things happen to Spider-Man but he doesn't learn from it. Can't get into any of the other characters cause they don't feel like people, they feel more like caricatures to me in this version going through the motions over and over and over again. I could go on but yeah these movies ain't for me cause they aren't character writing stories. They're universe building stories. Not really the right fit for a SpiderMan movie imo. No growth or anything but whatever. Most of the growth that was present in this movie (thank god) was from the fam service stuff going on (iykyk) \\n\\nI'm not gonna get into too much but it's just the writing I'm griping so much about, so much just happens for the sake of the plot and once you notice it it's just really off putting. I'm not buying into the hype, I'm literally just trying to look at it from an objective POV and it has a lot of problems if you look in the right places and not let the initial hype sit with you \\n\\nMost of the actors did a great job though. Performances with what they were given were solid. Willem Dafoe ate that script for breakfast lol with a lot less screen time than the rest. \\nIf you turn your brain off and watch it for just entertainment yeah cool, but if you sit through it you can pick out a LOT of flaws going on. Just retconning any or all issues and wiping the slate clean ain't it for me chief.
